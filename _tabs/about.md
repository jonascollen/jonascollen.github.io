![Me](/assets/images/small.jpg)

Passionate network engineer with over 10 years of experience working with core & edge networking at a Service-provider.
For the last few years iÂ´ve been working around 50% as a developer focused on different automation-projects.  

I'm currently studying for Cisco DevNet Professional during my free time (when I manage to find it) and some AWS Cloud. Recently visited Cisco Live in Amsterdam too so i'm really motivated to try out a bunch of cool stuff that was shown (CI/CD etc).

This is a very old blog I started back in 2013 when I first started studying for CCNP/CCIE, it lived on until 2019 when I became a dad. Never stoped tinkering with new stuff though and it looked like a fun project to deploy a Jekyll-site, so this my attempt to resurrect the old wordpress-blog over to Jekyll with Git and CI/CD instead.

I might even get some inspiration to start posting now and then again but that remains to be seen.. :)
