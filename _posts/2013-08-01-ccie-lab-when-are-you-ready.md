> It’s the question on the mind of every CCIE candidate:  when am I ready to take the lab? Here are some signs you’re getting close.
> 
> 1.  You can do EIGRP metric computations.  With non-default K-values.  In your head.
> 2.  Your 5 year old knows which piece of practice gear to power cycle when you say “R1″.
> 3.  You have developed a personal relationship with the proctor that shows up in your dreams.
> 4.  The word “mutation” makes you think of DSCP, not genetics.
> 5.  You write your own redistribution practice labs because you think your vendor’s are too easy.
> 6.  You know Brian Dennis’ CCIE number, his specialties, and when he earned them.
> 7.  You hate the guy who decided that internal & external OSPF routes should have the same AD by default.
> 8.  You re-write ACLs at work using non-contiguous wildcard masks, just because you can.
> 9.  Dueling with a mock lab seems like an excellent way to spend a Saturday.
> 10.  You have printed over 1,000 pages of DocCD PDFs and read them during lunch hours, neither of which strike you as odd behaviors.
